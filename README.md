##disclaimer;
We strongly discourage bringing modified files online. Unauthorized modifications to data files violate the Xbox LIVE ToS. We are not responsible for anything that happens to your console, account, and/or your dignity. 

Nitrogen is licensed under GPLv3. The full license text is available in the LICENSE file.

##requirements;
If you have a JTAG or RGH, you will need to use Xbox Neighborhood to send gametypes to your Xbox. Navigate to the *cache:/autosave/* directory to manipulate the temporary history and avoid dealing with STFS packages.

Otherwise, you'll have to resort to using a flash drive. Make sure that your flash drive was formatted by your Xbox. Nitrogen is currently unable to work with STFS container (CON) files, so you will need to extract/inject the variant BLF file. We recommend you use [Velocity](https://github.com/hetelek/Velocity).

In order to compile Nitrogen, you will need the latest version of the .NET Framework and Visual Studio IDE. You will also need the [Code Contracts extension](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1ec7db13-3363-46c9-851f-1ce455f66970) for Visual Studio.
