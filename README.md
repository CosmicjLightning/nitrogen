#nitrogen

##about;
Nitrogen is a .NET library with the ultimate goal of making it super duper easy to modify user-generated files in Halo. The current focus is on Halo 4 gametypes but there are plans to extend Nitrogen to support other games and content types such as map variants.

##requirements;
If you have a JTAG, RGH, or a dev kit, you will need to use Xbox Neighborhood to send gametypes to your Xbox. Navigate to the *cache0:/autosave/* directory to manipulate the temporary history and avoid dealing with STFS packages.

Otherwise, you'll have to resort to using a flash drive. Make sure that your flash drive was formatted by your Xbox. Nitrogen is currently unable to work with STFS container (CON) files, so you will need to extract/inject the variant BLF file. We recommend you use [Velocity](https://github.com/hetelek/Velocity).


##how do I use this?
Bundled with Nitrogen is a small tool called **Nitrogen Variant Builder**.
