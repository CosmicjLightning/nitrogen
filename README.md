##disclaimer;
We love Halo so if you're a scumbag who wants to cheat and ruin someone else's day, look elsewhere because you won't find anything "useful" here. We strongly discourage bringing modified files online even though they are harmless. Unauthorized modifications to data files violate the Xbox LIVE ToS. We are not responsible for anything that happens to your console, account, and/or your dignity. 

Nitrogen is licensed under GPLv3. The full license text is available in the LICENSE file.

##requirements;
If you have a JTAG or RGH, you will need to use Xbox Neighborhood to send gametypes to your Xbox. Navigate to the *cache:/autosave/* directory to manipulate the temporary history and avoid dealing with STFS packages.

Otherwise, you'll have to resort to using a flash drive. Make sure that your flash drive was formatted by your Xbox. Nitrogen is currently unable to work with STFS container (CON) files, so you will need to extract/inject the variant BLF file. We recommend you use [Velocity](https://github.com/hetelek/Velocity).

In order to compile Nitrogen, you will need the latest version of the .NET Framework and Visual Studio IDE. You will also need the [Code Contracts extension](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1ec7db13-3363-46c9-851f-1ce455f66970) for Visual Studio.
