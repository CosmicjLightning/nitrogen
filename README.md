#Nitrogen - Halo Content API

##about;
Nitrogen is a .NET library with the ultimate goal of making it super duper easy to modify user-generated files in Halo. The current focus is on Halo 4 gametypes but there are plans to extend Nitrogen to support other games and content types such as map variants.

##disclaimer;
We love Halo. We love Bungie. We love 343 Industries. It took a handful of dedicated Halo fans over a year to get to this point. Please don't be dumb and ruin it for the rest of us.

Nitrogen is licensed under GPLv3. The full license text is available in the LICENSE file.

##requirements;
If you have a JTAG, RGH, or a dev kit, you will need to use Xbox Neighborhood to send gametypes to your Xbox. Navigate to the *cache0:/autosave/* directory to manipulate the temporary history and avoid dealing with STFS packages.

Otherwise, you'll have to resort to using a flash drive. Make sure that your flash drive was formatted by your Xbox. Nitrogen is currently unable to work with STFS container (CON) files, so you will need to extract/inject the variant BLF file. We recommend you use [Velocity](https://github.com/hetelek/Velocity).

##how do I use this?
Bundled with Nitrogen is a small tool called **Nitrogen Variant Builder**.
